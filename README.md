Pakrat
-------

A tool to mirror and version YUM repositories

What does it do?
----------------

* You invoke pakrat and pass it some information about your repositories.
* Pakrat mirrors the YUM repositories, and optionally arranges the data in a
  versioned manner.

It is easiest to demonstrate what Pakrat does by shell example:
```
$ pakrat --repodir /etc/yum.repos.d

  repo              done/total       complete    metadata
  -------------------------------------------------------
  base               357/6381        5%          -         
  updates            112/1100        10%         -         
  extras              13/13          100%        complete  

  total:             482/7494        6%

```

Features
--------

* Mirror repository packages from remote sources
* Optional repository versioning with user-defined version schema
* Mirror YUM group metadata
* Supports standard YUM configuration files
* Supports YUM configuration directories (repos.d style)
* Supports command-line repos for zero-configuration (`--name` and `--baseurl`)
* Command-line interface with real-time progress indicator
* Parallel repository downloads for maximum effeciency
* Syslog integration
* Supports user-specified callbacks

Installation
------------

Pakrat is available in PyPI as `pakrat`. That means you can install it with
easy_install:

```
# easy_install pakrat
```

*NOTE*
Installation from PyPI should work on any Linux. However, since Pakrat depends
on YUM and Createrepo, which are not available in PyPI, these dependencies will
not be detected as missing. The easiest install path is to install on some kind
of RHEL like so:

```
# yum -y install createrepo
# easy_install pakrat
```

How to use it
-------------

The simplest possible example would involve mirroring a YUM repository in a
very basic way, using the CLI:

```
$ pakrat --name centos --baseurl http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64
$ tree -d centos
centos/
├── Packages
└── repodata
```

A slightly more complex example would be to version the same repository. To
do this, you must pass in a version number. An easy example is to mirror a
repository daily.
```
$ pakrat \
    --repoversion $(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
    --name centos \
    --baseurl http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64
$ tree -d centos
centos/
├── 2013-07-29
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── latest -> 2013-07-29
└── Packages
```

If you were to configure the above to command to run on a daily schedule,
eventually you would see something like:
```
$ tree -d centos
centos/
├── 2013-07-29
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── 2013-07-30
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── 2013-07-31
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── latest -> 2013-07-31
└── Packages
```

Pakrat is also capable of handling multiple YUM repositories in the same mirror
run. If multiple repositories are specified, each repository will get its own
download thread. This is handy if you are syncing from a mirror that is not
particularly quick. The other repositories do not need to wait on it to finish.
```
$ pakrat \
    --repoversion $(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
    --name centos --baseurl http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64 \
    --name epel --baseurl http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64
$ tree -d centos epel
centos/
├── 2013-07-29
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── latest -> 2013-07-29
└── Packages
epel/
├── 2013-07-29
│   ├── Packages -> ../Packages
│   └── repodata
├── latest -> 2013-07-29
└── Packages
```

Configuration can also be passed in from YUM configuration files. See the CLI
`--help` for details.

Pakrat also exposes its interfaces in plain python for integration with other
projects and software. A good starting point for using Pakrat via the python
API is to take a look at the `pakrat.sync` method. The CLI calls this method
almost exclusively, so it should be fairly straightforward in its usage (all
arguments are named and optional):
```
pakrat.sync(basedir, objrepos, repodirs, repofiles, repoversion, delete, callback)
```

Another handy python method is `pakrat.repo.factory`, which creates YUM
repository objects so that no file-based configuration is needed.
```
pakrat.repo.factory(name, baseurls=None, mirrorlist=None)
```

User-defined callbacks
----------------------

Since the YUM team did a decent job at externalizing the progress data,
pakrat will return the favor by exposing the same data, plus some extras
via user callbacks.

A user callback is a simple class that implements some methods for handling
received data. It is not mandatory to implement any of the methods.

A few of the available user callbacks in pakrat come directly from the
`urlgrabber` interface (namely, any user callback beginning with `download_`.
The other methods are called by pakrat, which explains why the interfaces
are varied.

The supported user callbacks are listed in the following method signatures:
```python
""" Called when the number of packages a repository contains becomes known """
repo_init(repo_id, num_pkgs)

""" Called when 'createrepo' begins running and when it completes """
repo_metadata(repo_id, status)

""" Called when a repository finishes downloading all packages """
repo_complete(repo_id)

""" Called whenever an exception is thrown from a repo thread """
repo_error(repo_id, error)

""" Called when a file begins downloading (non-exclusive) """
download_start(repo_id, fpath, url, fname, fsize, text)

""" Called during downloads, 'size' is bytes downloaded """
download_update(repo_id, size)

""" Called when a file download completes, 'size' is file size in bytes """
download_end(repo_id, size)
```

The following is a basic example of how to use user callbacks in pakrat.
Note that an instance of the class is passed into the `pakrat.sync()` call
as the named argument `callback`.

```python
import pakrat

class mycallback(object):
    def log(self, msg):
        with open('log.txt', 'a') as logfile:
            logfile.write('%s\n' % msg)

    def repo_init(self, repo_id, num_pkgs):
        self.log('Found %d packages in repo %s' % (num_pkgs, repo_id))

    def download_start(self, repo_id, _file, url, basename, size, text):
        self.fname = basename

    def download_end(self, repo_id, size):
        if self.fname.endswith('.rpm'):
            self.log('%s, repo %s, size %d' % (self.fname, repo_id, size))

    def repo_metadata(self, repo_id, status):
        self.log('Metadata for repo %s is now %s' % (repo_id, status))

myrepo = pakrat.repo.factory(
    'extras',
    mirrorlist='http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?repo=extras&release=6&arch=x86_64'
)

mycallback_instance = mycallback()
pakrat.sync(objrepos=[myrepo], callback=mycallback_instance)
```

If you run the above example, and then take a look in the `log.txt` file (which
the user callbacks should have created), you will see something like:

```
Found 13 packages in repo extras
bakefile-0.2.8-3.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm, repo extras, size 256356

```

Building an RPM
---------------

Pakrat can be easily packaged into an RPM.

1. Download a release and name the tarball `pakrat.tar.gz`:
```
curl -o pakrat.tar.gz -L https://github.com/ryanuber/pakrat/archive/master.tar.gz
```

2. Build it into an RPM:
```
rpmbuild -tb pakrat.tar.gz
```

What's missing
--------------

* Optional "all" repository containing all known versions
* Combined repositories?
